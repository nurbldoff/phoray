A "physical" raytracer written in python.

This is a raytracer written in python. It's different from most raytracers in that it calculates the rays *forward* in the direction of light propagation, instead of backwards from the image plane. It is not intended for producing images of reflective spheres, but rather for simulating optical systems.


== Installation ==

*TODO*


== Dependencies ==

Phoray depends on 'NumPy' (http://www.numpy.org/).


== Usage ==

See examples. TODO: update the examples.

There is also an experimental and rather incomplete browser UI, which can be started by running "python server.py" in the phoray directory. Then point a modern, webgl capable browser to http://localhost:8080 and play around. (Note: only recent versions of Chrome and Firefox have been tested and are known to work.)


== Running unit tests ==

Run "nosetests" (requires 'Nose' to be installed).
